When the device boots it determines the set of network interfaces.
By default this is determined by extracting the manufacturer and model
strings from dmidecode; /opt/zededa/bin/hardwaremodel does this determination.

That model string is used to look up a json file in /var/tmp/zededa/DeviceNetworkConfig/
If no such json file is found the device uses /var/tmp/zededa/DeviceNetworkConfig/default.json

Those files merely specify the set of management ports, plus which of them
do not have per usage charging (to separate out LTE modems).
The default.json is:
{
    "Uplink":["eth0","wlan0","wwan0"],
    "FreeUplinks":["eth0","wlan0"]
}
Note that this uses the old "uplink" terminology; new terminology is
"management port".

This per-model comfiguration can be overridden by an optional file in
/config which is added when the image is built/installed.
That file is /config/DevicePortConfig/override.json

That file can specify multiple management interfaces, and can specify static IP
and DNS configuration (for environments where DHCP is not used). In addition it
can specify proxies using different mechanism.

An example file to specify using WPAD to retrieve proxy configuration on eth0 is:
{
    "Ports": [
        {
            "AddrSubnet": "",
            "Dhcp": 4,
            "DnsServers": null,
            "DomainName": "",
            "Exceptions": "",
            "Free": true,
            "Gateway": "",
            "IfName": "eth0",
            "IsMgmt": true,
            "NetworkProxyEnable": true,
            "NetworkProxyURL": "",
            "NtpServer": "",
            "Pacfile": "",
            "Proxies": null
        }
    ]
}

An example file with eth0 being static and eth1 using dhcp is:
{
    "Ports": [
        {
            "AddrSubnet": "38.108.181.238/24", 
            "Dhcp": 1,
            "DnsServers": [
                "8.8.8.8"
            ],
            "DomainName": "",
            "Free": true,
            "Gateway": "38.108.181.254",
            "IfName": "eth0",
            "IsMgmt": true,
            "NtpServer": "38.108.181.254",
            "NetworkProxyEnable": false,
            "NetworkProxyURL": "",
            "NtpServer": "",
            "Pacfile": "",
            "Proxies": null
        },
        {
            "Dhcp": 4,
            "Free": true,
            "IfName": "eth1",
            "IsMgmt": true
        }
    ]
}

In addition the above can be specified from the EV-controller by specifying one
or more networks with the proxy and/or static as part of the zcli device create.
