New zedmanager - no TLS
    Has the hwupdate and swupdate clients.
    Runs server as well (how?) PUSH of swconfig, GET of swstatus
    (is there also a patch of swconfig? Use directory with /var/tmp/zededa/swconfig/<eidOrName>/<version>
    SwConfig includes URL, DigestAlg, Digest (Eid, Name, Version also sent)
    SwConfig has a type (Image, Disk - with location attribute, Resource? ACL?)
    SwConfig has a signer (base64Url of cert? or pem?)
    ZedManager/dom0 has root cert; need cert chain from somewhere...
    XXX where, how do we get the peer cert chain and save it for verification?

    XXX type=process? Install in /var/tmp/zededa/app/<EID>/<version> and assume
    there is a ./run program? Works for the python apps.
    Throwaway!

Hierarchical structure?
    SwConfig -> Components list
        Each component has a URL, digest, digestalg?
	Also displayName, version?? 
    Signer, signature on all of SwConfig
    Means two levels and not hierarchical.
    Version and name in SwConfig. Means doing diffs when the version changes to
    detect that component X did not change its digest. XXX should we have informative version strings for the components? Still compare the digest? Or compare both?

Move to /usr/local/etc/lisp

lisp_directory = "/root/lispers.net/" if docker else "/home/pi/lispers.net/"

What about /var/tmp? Just a mock up.
Might want to have it survive reboot hence move to /var/zededa/device and
/var/zededa/onboarding.
