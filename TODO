Need ZedCloud EIDs in clients config.
     Do not go into the LISP config.
     Add "ZedControl" IP addresses - list
     Later ZedLake IP addresses - list?

lisp_directory = "/root/lispers.net/" if docker else "/home/pi/lispers.net/"

What about /var/tmp? Just a mock up.
Might want to have it survive reboot hence move to /var/zededa/device and
/var/zededa/onboarding.
