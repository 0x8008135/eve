TODO ethtool setup in domU for checksum? How to make permanent?
	sudo ethtool -K eth1 tx-checksum-ipv6 off
	Set default in (shared?) kernel?
	Or can we force in dom0/ netback?
Needed for x86 as well.
TODO try with other mangle setup..

TODO 20-30 second outage when we add/delete a domU/EID as reported by
     ping6 zedcontrol
     
TODO kernel=Image is external to domU; how to specify external kernel which needs to be downloaded?
Ditto for initrd?
Q: target=kernel? plus "extKernel=true"?


TODO add device mapping to support gpiotoled.
TODO add cpu binding for rtos
TODO what is needed for docker/rkt?

TODO rename displayName to localDNSName?
     Should we allow for empty? Also used for xen domain.
TODO should we have one name per overlay?

DONE bundles of bundles vs. attach to overlay uuid?

TODO domU needs to know which overlay is which and diff than IPv6 underlay.
TODO domU needs /128 routes for multiple IPv6 overlays?

TODO name for StorageConfig*?
     Is both an Image description and aspects of the container for the image
     ImageDeploymentConfig and ImageDeploymentStatus?
     
TODO wait code - introduce second layer of interfaces to remove duplicate code

TODO create domain name ipsets on the fly. Easy in handleCreate
   Requires some care in handleModify
TODO handleModify's update to ACLs assumes there is no DROP rules since does inserts new rules up front.
   Need to generate new list of rules and then just apply them?
   (Using save/restore for efficiency? Should we use restore for initial set
   as well for efficiency?)
TODO xenmgr goroutines

TODO Create DeviceSwStatus separate from DeviceSwResources
Include uplink interfaces, available memory and disk
DONE NAT i.e. uplink global address? (From exchanges with ZedControl).
Trigger such exchange when local interface/address change.
DeviceSwStatus upload results in an ack containing the global address.

DONE device-steps.sh - mode (from file or arg) to only run zedrouter for ctrl01?
     Check we can create dbo1x0.
     Also move ctrl01's code to /opt
     
DONE geolocation of clientIP -> hwStatus

Q: are we accepting east-west traffic on mgmt iid?
A: only those listed in zedrouter*.json.

DONE add dmidecode output to HwStatus
     dmidecode -s system-manufacturer
	  system-product-name
	  system-version
	  system-serial-number
	  system-uuid

DONE dnsmasq add tar file
DONE dnsmasq path "/"
DONE radvd path "/"

DONE EID from gopi to hikey0x: fd7b:7e5b:b572:40cf:aee4:ae25:6751:f609
DONE /etc/group for amd64 ubuntu domu - sudo group and nordmark/zededa groups

DONE zedcontrol shouldn't have eids.dbo1x0 set rule. Needs to accept everybody?
     Made it conditional on /opt/zededa/etc/infra file.
     Workaround: ip6tables -F OUTPUT

DONE avoid empty additional strings:
	`json:",omitempty"`

DONE add location information in additional json RLOC

DONE remove Src for fd00::/8 route
DONE zedrouter/radvd mtu 1280
	AdvLinkMTU  1280     
DONE zedrouter/radvd route for fd00::/8 and lower preference
     route fd00::/8 { xxx };
DONE set mtu 1280 on dbo1x0
DONE rc.local /opt

DONE move device-steps to /opt
DONE lisp wait for stopped
DONE lisp cd in STOP-LISP
DONE lisp not picking up packets until manual restart
    added wait time
    
DONE remove local names from dnsmasq: have
	nordmark@ubuntu:~$ ping zedtest4
	PING zedtest4 (172.27.2.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
	No option to dnsmasq to skip DHCP entries
	Using uuid as dhcp hostname
	
DONE dnsmasgq rename
DONE ACL DROP remove... 
DONE log.fmt when directory has been scanned?
DONE dnsmasq - remove /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases on boot
DONE downloader runs ... sleep to wait for verifierStatus?
DONE log.fmt when agent starts.

===

packets sent by dom0/zedmanager hit the OUTPUT rule for dbo1x0 match-set.
Workaround:
ip6tables -I FORWARD -o dbo1x0 -m set --match-set eids.bo1x2 src -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -I FORWARD -o dbo1x0 -m set --match-set eids.bo1x1 src -j ACCEPT
DONE by not having dbo1x0 ACLs

FIXED eidregister/server: reusing uuid for a newly allocated eid (Allocate=True)
runs into issues; server fails it.

xenmanager:
DONE - delete file on delete (preserves dhcp lease file for unrelated AI)
DONE - (busy) wait in handleDelete before above delete.
DONE - pass Activate in DomainConfig? Copy file if !Activate
DONE - check Preserve on handleModify with !Activate
DONE - handleModify when Activate is set

verifier:
DONE - Add refcount against sha256.

acl/iptables:
DONE - local forwarding doesn't work due to
   379 39416 DROP       all      bo1x1  *       ::/0                 ::/0          Since fd00::/8 route is out dbo1x0 sufficient to drop there.
   We have a raw entry checking src/dst

DONE xenmgr - rename to domainmgr

zedmanager:
FIXED  - Adding a config file after boot results in
         AIC not found and then a handleModify, which does nothing.
DONE - Set DomainConfig with Active=false
DONE - Need handleDelete to clean up all dependent files
DONE - Need modification for ACL and eidlist in handlezedrouter

zedrouter:
NO - Seems to re-add the iptables rules for each handleModify. CHECK
 
device-steps.sh:
DONE - Need cleanup of dependent /var/run/*/config, however we have two global files
       plus the IsZedmanager zedrouter/config; preserve zedmanager/config/
DONE - keep downloads directory in place as well

NOTE:
ubuntu guest and zedrouter assumes bu is first in list of networks - becomes eth0

DONE move dnsmasq and radvd from /etc to /var/run/zedrouter/

xenmgr
 - How do we wait for state?
 - How do we find out crashed? boot failures show up as "r"
DONE - How do we always delete? Wait state to change after xl shutdown then xl destroy and wait again? Means a goroutine per UUID?
   It could periodically look for status and update.
   
DONE zedmanager:
N/A - special handling of IsZedManager - do we create it's file on the fly
   from onboarding? Don't pass to DomainMgr.
DONE - 1st read status from everybody and build collections in memory
   Implies handle* for multiple input collections.
   Should it produce status for ZedCloud?
DONE - 2nd read config from ZedCloud/dir

New zedmanager - no TLS
    Has the hwupdate and swupdate clients.
    Runs server as well (how?) PUSH of swconfig, GET of swstatus
    (is there also a patch of swconfig? Use directory with /var/tmp/zededa/swconfig/<eidOrName>/<version>
    SwConfig includes URL, DigestAlg, Digest (Eid, Name, Version also sent)
    SwConfig has a type (Image, Disk - with location attribute, Resource? ACL?)
    SwConfig has a signer (base64Url of cert? or pem?)
    ZedManager/dom0 has root cert; need cert chain from somewhere...

    XXX where, how do we get the peer cert chain and save it for verification?

    XXX type=process? Install in /var/tmp/zededa/app/<EID>/<version> and assume
    there is a ./run program? Works for the python apps.
    Throwaway!

Hierarchical structure?
    SwConfig -> Components list
        Each component has a URL, digest, digestalg?
	Also displayName, version?? 
    Signer, signature on all of SwConfig
    Means two levels and not hierarchical.
    Version and name in SwConfig. Means doing diffs when the version changes to
    detect that component X did not change its digest. XXX should we have informative version strings for the components? Still compare the digest? Or compare both?

Move to /usr/local/etc/lisp

lisp_directory = "/root/lispers.net/" if docker else "/home/pi/lispers.net/"

===

What about /var/tmp? Just a mock up.
Might want to have it survive reboot hence move to /var/zededa/device and
/var/zededa/onboarding.
