# go-provision
Onboarding and provisioning client and mock server in go

The overall flow is as follows:
1. Install provisioning binaries and config files in /usr/local/bin/zededa
and /usr/local/etc/zededa
      scp -p prov01.priv.sc.zededa.net:/home/nordmark/go-provision/go-provision.linux_arm64.tar.gz /tmp
OR
      scp -p prov01.priv.sc.zededa.net:/home/nordmark/go-provision/go-provision.linux_x86_64.tar.gz /tmp

      cd /usr/local/
      sudo tar xf /tmp/go-provision.linux_*.tar.gz


2. Generate an onboarding certificate (7 day lifetime) on the server and
   register it with the server.
   Example:
      ssh prov01.priv.sc.zededa.net
      cd ~nordmark/go-provision
      mkdir /tmp/`whoami`
      ./generate-onboard.sh /tmp/`whoami`/onboard
      ./bin/register myself@zededa.com /tmp/`whoami`/onboard.cert.pem 3
   The above registration allows to use the onboarding certificate for 3 devices
   Generate-onboard produces two /tmp/`whoami`/onboard.*.pem files.
   Copy those files to your client device in /usr/local/etc/zededa/
      scp -p prov01.priv.sc.zededa.net:/tmp/`whoami`/onboard.\*.pem /usr/local/etc/zededa
      
   Then remove the private onboarding key and cert on the prov01 server:
      rm -rf /tmp/`whoami`/onboard*

Above steps are supposed to be done as part of the user requesting an
image for their device(s) at e.g. developer.zededa.com


3. Run through the provisioning steps on the device
   /usr/local/bin/zededa/device-steps.sh -w
   
   Note that if the clocks are not in sync between the device and the prov01
   server you'll see some errors and retries of the form:

   device-param statuscode 401 Unauthorized
   deviceCert too early NotBefore 2017-05-10 20:34:27 +0000 UTC, now 2017-05-10 13:33:42.990013239 -0700 PDT


====

Server config on prov01:
1. Create server config in /usr/local/etc/zededa-server containing the following files
   intermediate-ca-chain.pem  server.cert.pem  server.key.pem

2. Start the server on a laptop or server
   Example:
	env -u https_proxy env -u http_proxy go-provision/bin/server
